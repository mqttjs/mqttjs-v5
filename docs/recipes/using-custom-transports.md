# Using Custom Transports

MQTT.js supports a BYOT (Bring Your Own Transport) approach to enable more complex Transport scenarios, such as country / company specific proxies. Your Transport must conform to the API set forth for all custom transports. 

```js
// TODO: Write sample of using custom transport. Maybe create ali.js for AliExpress as example since it is in old library.
```
